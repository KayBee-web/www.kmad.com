    <p class="auto-style9" >During my years at varsity, it has been difficult years of my life and challenging too. Then covid made things more difficult in my second year as I still trying to find my feet. I spent most of my first year being in the dark and overwhelmed by the environment(it was my first time spending a lot of time around white people and being taught in Afrikaans, which I had to rely on translators always), Also the workload and the fact that was getting introduced to programming and feeling that I'm the only student who did not do programming at high school and having no idea about programming. My first year was tough even though I manage to complete it without repeating any module, but at some point, I once considered the option of changing Information Technology to something else. However, as time goes I got the motivation to complete what I started and always loved, it is always good to do what you love as it will always give you that drive and joy. it was always hard to see one or two black students in the class. But that also gives me that motivation to be who I'm and gives me drive and also overcome my anxieties and start to perform better in my academics. even though during covid-19, it was difficult I managed to obtain a few Distinctions which helped me in the year 2021 to become a Demi and also a marker.</p>

    <p class="auto-style9" >During these years of varsity, I learnt that there is always ups and downs in life which you must be able to face, also use them to your advantage gain experience from those ups and downs and then as your learning curve in life.</p>
