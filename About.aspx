        About Me</p>
    <br />
    <p class="auto-style8" >I'm currently a student studying towards Bsc Information Technology. My love for IT developed during grade 10 when I started to learn more development in AI. to develop Apps, monitor, and manage computer hardware, software and networks come with enjoyment (what I mean is I enjoy working on a computer). During the years of obtaining the degree in IT, I enjoyed 

       creating programs, working with different technology stacks(Front and Backend). When on the computer I enjoy doing magic with code and 

       also seeing people's reactions when working with me on certain projects. What I love most is solving what is considered to be difficult and 

      always up for a challenge, most importantly always eager to learn and work with different languages/frameworks. In conclusion, I'm 

      passionate about technology and excited about the future, also to learn a lot in the industry.
    </p>

<p class="auto-style8" >I'm originally from Limpopo. my favourite thing in the world is going to soccer grounds ,either to play or watch others play, it gives me that enjoyment(although i'm not good at soccer but it's always what i enjoy doing to play/kick the ball).
My social medias are found under "Details" which are Instagram and LinkedIn(i'm more active on Instagram).
